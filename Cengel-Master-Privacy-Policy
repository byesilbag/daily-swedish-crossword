## 2. Information We Collect
**We do not collect, store, or share any personal information on our servers.**

### 2.1. Game Data
All game progress, puzzle completions, diamond balances, and settings are stored locally on your device. We do not upload or sync your game data to any external server.

Subscriptions, in-app purchases, and payments are processed directly by the **Apple App Store**. We do not have access to your credit card information or billing details.
